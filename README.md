# Stickbot
The Official Bot for the [CustomGCC Discord Server](https://discord.customg.cc), providing basic quality of life improvements to the server.

Based off of Gifkin, the Icons: Combat Arena discord bot, and the successor to Zhubot, the previous CGCC bot which died in a tragic lightning strike. 

## How does it work?
Stickbot is a Discord Bot powered by [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). The Bot is being regularly maintained and updated to meet the needs of the growing CGCC community, and supports things like automatic role distribution, removal of messages with harmful content, server usage information, and more. If you have suggestions for what the bot should do, let the Mod team know!

## Features
* Server info (Can tell you how many members have joined the server, and how many are online)
* Message analytics (Can tell you who are the most frequent posters in a given channel)
* Dynamic Text Commands (Any mod can create a command that will return text that is available to all users)
* Channel cleanup
* Spam filtering
* and much more!

## Usage
Stickbot is very particularly tailored to use within the CGCC server, but with a bit of work (likely removing unused components), you can bring him to your own server! (Considering this is what we had to do to use Gifkin for CGCC, it's very doable!)

/src/config.js will run upon running the bot, and will create the files you'll need to get it up and running. Populate these with the appropriate information and you'll be all set.

## Credits
Stickbot was forked from Gifkin, and reworked and maintained by Tyler "NFreak" Morrow, one of the founding admins of CGCC.

Gifkin was originally written by Adam "WaveParadigm" Gincel, who is a member of the Mod team on the Icons Discord Server.

The original Zhubot that inspired Stickbot was written by Mui of the CGCC Discord server staff.
